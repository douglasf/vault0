# Task Delegation

> **Applies if**: you have `vault0-task-list`, `vault0-task-subtasks`, and `vault0-task-move` in your tools, AND you delegate work to other agents.

## Delegation Loop

Only runs when the user explicitly asks to implement tasks (e.g., "implement <ULID>", "work through the tasks"). Does NOT auto-start after commits or approvals.

**IMPORTANT**: If the instruction is to implement something with many steps (task with subtasks, or a plan), CONTINUE UNTIL THERE ARE NO MORE TASKS THAT SATISFY THE INITIAL REQUEST.

1. **Discover**: Fresh query every iteration. Never reuse prior results.
   - If user provided a ULID: `vault0-task-subtasks(id, ready: true)`
   - Otherwise: `vault0-task-list(ready: true)`
2. **Pick**: Highest priority first — critical → high → normal → low. Same priority: first returned.
3. **Delegate**: One agent call per task, parallelize where possible.
   - **ALWAYS include the task ID** in the delegation prompt so the receiving agent can claim it. Use: `Task ID: <full-ULID>` at the top.
   - Include the task description/requirements in the prompt body.
4. **Repeat**: Fresh `vault0-task-list(ready: true)` or `vault0-task-subtasks(id, ready: true)` after each delegation round completes. Continue until none ready.

## Parent Promotion

When `vault0-task-subtasks(id, ready: true)` returns empty for a parent task, move the parent to `in_review` via `vault0-task-move`.

## Assignment Rules

- Only delegate tasks that are **ready** and in `backlog`/`todo`.
- Skip `in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`, `cancelled`.

## Status Boundaries

- You may move tasks to `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, or `cancelled`.
- You may NEVER move tasks to `done`. Only `vault0-task-complete` does that — and only if you have it.
- Treat `in_review` as "complete" for dependency resolution — downstream tasks unblock.

## Natural Language Approval

When user says "approve", "LGTM", "ship it", etc.:
1. `vault0-task-list(status: "in_review")`
2. If you have `vault0-task-complete`: complete them directly.
3. If you don't: delegate to an agent that does.

## Quick Task Creation

User says "create a task": use `vault0-task-add` (if available) with `sourceFlag: "opencode"`. Return the ID.

## Post-Commit Boundary

After a commit completes: relay results and **STOP**. Do NOT query for next tasks, suggest continuation, or report unblocked work. User must explicitly request new work.

## Error Handling

If a delegated agent reports failure: stop the loop, report to user, wait for direction. Failed tasks may block dependents.

## Completion

When `vault0-task-list(ready: true)` returns empty: either all done (summarize) or remaining blocked (report what's waiting on what).
